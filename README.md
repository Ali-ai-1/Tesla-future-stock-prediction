#Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a short-term stock price prediction system using historical stock market data. The objective is to predict the **next day's closing price** of a selected stock (e.g., Tesla - TSLA) based on key market indicators like `Open`, `High`, `Low`, and `Volume`.

---

##Project Overview

-Load historical stock data using the [Yahoo Finance API](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
-Train machine learning models using:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Linear Regression (for comparison)
-Predict and visualize the stock‚Äôs closing price
-Predict the next day's closing price using the latest available data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Python 3**
- `yfinance` ‚Äì to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance
- `pandas` & `numpy` ‚Äì for data handling
- `scikit-learn` ‚Äì for ML models
- `matplotlib` ‚Äì for data visualization
